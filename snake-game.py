# INSTRUCTIONS: - UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, ARROWS TO PLAY
#               - 'SPACEBAR' TO PAUSE / RESUME
#               - PRESS 'ESC' BUTTON WHILE THE IS CURSER MOVING TO QUIT. WILL NOT ESCAPE IF PAUSED.
#               - HAVE FUN!! It's even more breaking down the code and understanding it all! :)

# UPDATE: Corrected my comments to reflect python syntax. No more "array".
